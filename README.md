Mapart Helper aims to make working with maparts as convenient and enjoyable as possible.
It provides a user-friendly interface for generating maparts from images.
By default, you can open the screen with the `Y` key (This can
be changed at the setting).

The mod generates palette directly from the client, giving you a complete list of blocks
available for each specific color.

It also includes other map-related features, such as saving maps from the world as PNG files or
displaying beams at the starting coordinates of map areas.

## Commands
The following commands can be used everywhere, including servers:
- `/mart beams` - Toggles displaying the beams at the map areas' start points
- `/mart save frame [filename]` - Saves the map's image you are looking at to the `saved_maps` folder
- `/mart save hand [filename]` - Saves the map's image you are looking at to the `saved_maps` folder
- `/mart save selection [filename]` - Saves the image from the selection area to the `saved_maps` folder
- `/mart palette regenerate` - Regenerates blocks palette
- `/mart palette update` - Updates palette and presets from config files

There are also several miscellaneous singleplayer-only commands, almost for debugging or for some unique cases:
- `/mart-creative palette give-map-palette` - Replaces an image of the holding filled map with the image of the complete palette
- `/mart-creative palette place <height>` - Places all blocks from the generated blocks palette into the world from the current map area's starting coordinates and at the given y-coordinate

### Rebane's MapartCraft
As someone who builds maparts in survival, I have always used this great website for that purpose.
So, of course, the main idea for this
mod was inspired by [MapartCraft](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/).
As a novice modder, I decided to create a similar tool, but integrated directly into the game.

Mapart Helper is an alternative that provides
in-game GUI for the same purposes, with some differences
and its own features.

MapartCraft and Mapart Helper use different programming languages,
algorithms, and logic. For this reason, the results <u>may and will differ</u>,
especially when it comes to image preprocessing.
Please keep this in mind if you want to use both tools for the same mapart.
